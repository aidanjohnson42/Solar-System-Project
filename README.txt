The code here was wrote for my final project in the Computer Simulation course I took during my second year (2019-2020) of my Astrophysics degree at Edinburgh University. The project was cancelled due to covid interuppting university, but the code has been made to be mostly complete and works at simulating the orbits of the inner solar system. The code is generalised, so more planets can be added to the simulation via the planet.sol file. Maintaining format of the prior entries is of course essential. I declare the code as solely my own work.
